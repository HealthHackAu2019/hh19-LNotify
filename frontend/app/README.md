## Introduction

A simple frontend to assist healthcare practitioners send out appointment reminders which get translated into a patient's langugage of choice. 

## Major Depends
- React
- Gatsby
- Semantic-UI

Based on the gatsby-semantic-ui-react starter template.
Merged into this project from: https://github.com/pmRed/HealthHack2019-LNotify-front

## How to use

You can run this project in dev mode by by doing the following  

```sh
gatsby develop
```

Gatsby will start up a web server for you and you are ready to go.

There is a dockerised version which will build and serve the site. 

If you've never worked with Gatsby before, I recommend [reading the documentation](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)


### Customizing Semantic UI

To customize Semantic UI you can find the appropriate files in `src/semantic/site`. To understand the file structure provided in that folder, please read the [Customization Guide](http://learnsemantic.com/developing/customizing.html) provided by Semantic UI.

The theme files are pre-filled with all available variables so you can just set them and forget them. As you save those files Gatsby will automatically re-compile your files.
